## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 
* Lab 3, part 1

  This lab was fun because this was the first lab with more than one part so it came with new challenges. Also using the CIN and COUT data types to print out the unit price of the best pizza. As well as using double for the unit price was something difficult to figure out at first. 

* Lab 8, part 2
  
  One of my more personal favorite labs as we learned how to play poker. Never really understood the concept of it and being able to program what the value of each card does. Would like to make it a live program someday for people to use.

* Lab 10, part 1
  
  My third favorite lab as it was one of the hardest ones to do because you had to make a file for the prime numbers. Also make true statements for the prime number. It felt so tedious to do but it was something that gave the feeling when you were done, you could be at ease now.
